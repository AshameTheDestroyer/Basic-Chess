# Basic-Chess
Just wanted to recreate one of my favorite games of all time.

This game has been created like half a year ago or so, but I still felt the need to publish it anyways, I won't say it's buggy, but rather it's incomplete, like, there's no checkmates mechanisms whatsoever, but it's still playable, if you're well-accustomed with its rules.
